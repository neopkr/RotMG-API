### Stat Character Fail
- Some cases on characters the "stats" can fail not showing up the real stats, for example, compare this two players
    - neopkr
    - worc
worc only have 1 character alive and has last seen hidden, but idk why in the page says 7/8 and the wrapper (using the class and span "span.player-stats") is capturing 5/8...
